## About

Eris is a private AI chat application that runs entirely on your device using Apple's MLX framework. Named after the dwarf planet that challenged our understanding of the solar system, Eris challenges the notion that AI must live in the cloud.

- üöÄ **Blazing Fast** - Powered by Apple Silicon and MLX
- üì° **Offline First** - Works without internet connection
- ü§ñ **Multiple Models** - Support for Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, and more
- üé® **Native Design** - Built with SwiftUI for a seamless Apple experience
- üíæ **Local Storage** - Your data never leaves your device
- üéØ **Syntax Highlighting** - Beautiful code blocks with syntax highlighting for 100+ languages
- üìù **Markdown Support** - Full markdown rendering for formatted text, lists, tables, and more

### A Note About the Commit History üò¥

If you're browsing through the commit history and wondering why there are so many commits that just say "commit"... well, I have a confession to make. 

I started this project late one night with zero intention of it becoming anything serious. It was supposed to be a quick experiment, maybe a few lines of code to test out MLX. But you know how it goes - "just one more feature" turned into "oh, this actually works!" which turned into "wait, people might actually use this."

So there I was, half-asleep, committing code with the eloquence of a zombie: "commit", "commit", "commit". By the time I realized this was becoming a real project, the damage was done. My git history looks like I fell asleep on the keyboard with my finger on the enter key.

I promise I'm usually better at commit messages. Usually. When I'm awake. ‚òï

*PS: If you're a hiring manager reading this, I swear this isn't representative of my professional work. Please check out my other repos where I actually wrote meaningful commit messages like "fix: resolved null pointer exception in user authentication flow" instead of just "commit" 47 times in a row.*
